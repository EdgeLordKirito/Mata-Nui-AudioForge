    #maybe ffmpeg cutting does not need to be part of this script could be extracted into a sister script
    #cut part
    #extract id from filename
    #lookup cut data
    #if data exists use that
    #else ask user
    #run ffmpeg and cut file
    #remove uncut file
    #cut part ends here
